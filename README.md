# Mobile VR Controller

This project allows a mobile phone to be used as a controller for a Virtual Reality world.

Specifically, an iPhone running iOS7+ sends UDP messages over wifi directly to a Unity app using the Oculus SDK.

In the Scripts directory are example batch files used to start and stop a local wifi network on Windows. Mac OSX users can click Create Network from the wifi menu.
